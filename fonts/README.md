## Fonts
Here is a massive collectino of bitmap fonts. I like bitmap fonts.
Includes all of Addy's bitmaps and Tecate's bitmaps.

## installation
Put these in /usr/share/fonts/ or wherever you keep your fonts, then run _fc-cache -fv_ to refresh your font cache.

## It doesn't work!
You may have to enable bitmap fonts for your system. Read more on the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fonts#Bitmap_formats "arch wiki").
