# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles and a whole lot of bitmap fonts to go with them. 

## Included
 - .Xresources for URxvt and such. The colour scheme is stored here, so go ahead and steal it from there.
 - Configs for i3 and polybar, as well as colour schemes for dunst and rofi.
 - .bashrc, .vimrc and the like.
 - A few scripts to automate some stuff. 
 - The fonts I'm using on my own machine.

Note that most of the included fonts are bitmap fonts (.pcf), which are no longer supported by pango since 1.44. To circumvent this I've wrapped some of them in the .otb format, so they can be used more or less anywhere.
  
## Requirements
 - dunst
 - i3 (or i3-gaps)
 - polybar
 - rofi
 - alacritty (optional)
 - picom (optional)
